SublimeD3R
==========

SublimeD3R is a simple plugin for Sublime Text 3 that allows you to call some of the d3r core tools from within Sublime Text. It may work with Sublime Text 2 - I haven't tried it so don't know.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository into your Packages folder

cd Packages_Folder_Somewhere

git clone https://github.com/ronanchilvers/sublime-d3r.git

Usage
-----

The default keybindings are

ctrl+shift+alt+d on Linux 
ctrl+super+alt+d on OSX

You can remap these of course if you want to.
