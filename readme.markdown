SublimeD3R
==========

SublimeD3R is a simple plugin for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) that allows you to call some of the [D3R](http://d3r.com) core tools from within Sublime Text. It may work with Sublime Text 2 - I haven't tried it so don't know.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository into your Packages folder

    cd <Packages_Folder_Somewhere>
    git clone https://github.com/ronanchilvers/sublime-d3r.git

The default keybindings are

You can remap these of course if you want to.
